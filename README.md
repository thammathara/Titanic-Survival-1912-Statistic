### R language

I created a statistical prediction about who will survive the Titanic sinking in 1912 by using logistic regression and evaluating the model using a confusion matrix. Based on my F1 scores, my prediction model result is a bit mildly overfit. To sum up, my final F1 score is 0.76 and 0.74 based on my given data, which is pretty acceptable.
